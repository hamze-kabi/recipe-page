## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sassy css(scss)

### What I learned

- I learned using sassy css, and it's robust features like mixin and nesting.
- Redundancy reduction using combinators
- Using !important (as the last resort)
- Using media queries for screen sizes bigger than mobile screens (Mobile-first workflow)
- Further information about MIME types

### Continued development

So far, I’ve been using plain Notepad instead of code editors and IDEs to familiarize myself with the syntaxes even further. This method has a flaw: it is harder to remain committed to DRY. Even though there are more tools for this principle while using SCSS, that’s why I used VS Code editor after completing the project to detect repetitions and redundancies and corrected them. In my next project, I’ll be using the same IDE to reduce redundancy and stay committed to DRY while writing.
